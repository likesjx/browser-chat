# Feature Specification: Interactive Chat Web Component

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-web`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create a web component that listens for the cmd-k(mac)/ctrl-k(pc) hotkey, web component pops and the user can enter a prompt. The webcomponent will use an ONNX (or in browser) model that the prompt will be used to infer against to get a response. The response will show below the input box and the focus will follow. The prompt and the model response will be saved as a pair in indexddb along with an embedding (vector db). If the user clicks in the input box again, the response will disappear. If the user clicks outside of the input and response or hits esc key, the both the response and the prompt will disappear."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: During response generation, what visual feedback should the user see? ‚Üí A: Streaming text (tokens appear word-by-word as generated)
- Q: When the AI model is still loading and the user tries to submit a prompt, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Queue the prompt and process when model ready, with a loading indicator displayed in the response area. Esc key cancels the queued/generating prompt, but the prompt text remains visible in the input box
- Q: When an error occurs during response generation (model failure, timeout), what should happen? ‚Üí A: Display error message, allow manual retry
- Q: If Cmd-K/Ctrl-K conflicts with existing page keyboard shortcuts, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Component takes precedence, blocks page shortcut
- Q: What storage limits and retention policy should apply to conversation history? ‚Üí A: Store unlimited until quota exceeded, then error

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user browsing any web page wants to quickly access an AI assistant without leaving their current context. They press a keyboard shortcut to summon a chat interface, type a question or prompt, and receive an AI-generated response immediately below their input. The conversation is automatically saved for future reference, and the interface can be dismissed or reset with simple interactions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is on a web page with the component active, **When** they press Cmd-K (Mac) or Ctrl-K (Windows/Linux), **Then** a chat input box appears on screen and receives keyboard focus
2. **Given** the user has entered a prompt in the input box, **When** they submit the prompt, **Then** the AI generates a response that displays below the input box
3. **Given** the AI response is displayed, **When** the response generation is complete, **Then** keyboard focus moves to the response area
4. **Given** the AI response is visible, **When** the user clicks back in the input box, **Then** the response disappears but the input remains
5. **Given** both input and response are visible, **When** the user clicks outside the component or presses the Esc key, **Then** both the input and response disappear completely
6. **Given** the user has submitted a prompt and received a response, **When** the interaction completes, **Then** the prompt-response pair is saved persistently with a searchable representation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user presses Cmd-K/Ctrl-K while another input element has focus? (Component intercepts and activates)
- How does the system handle rapid repeated keyboard shortcut presses? (Should prevent duplicate activations)
- What happens if the AI model fails to generate a response or times out? (Display error message with manual retry option)
- How does the component behave when multiple instances are embedded on the same page? (Needs definition)
- What happens when the persistent storage quota is exceeded? (Display error message to user)
- How does the system handle extremely long prompts or responses? (Needs definition)
- What occurs when the AI model is still loading and the user tries to submit a prompt? (Queue prompt, show loading indicator, allow Esc to cancel)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST activate a chat interface when the user presses Cmd-K on macOS or Ctrl-K on Windows/Linux
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a text input box when activated and automatically focus it for immediate typing
- **FR-003**: System MUST accept multi-line text input from the user as a prompt
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate a response to the user's prompt using an in-browser language model
- **FR-005**: System MUST display the generated response immediately below the input box
- **FR-006**: System MUST move keyboard focus to the response area when generation completes
- **FR-007**: System MUST hide the response when the user clicks back into the input box
- **FR-008**: System MUST hide both input and response when the user clicks outside the component boundaries
- **FR-009**: System MUST hide both input and response when the user presses the Esc key and no generation is active
- **FR-010**: System MUST save each prompt-response pair to persistent storage after generation completes
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate and store a searchable representation of each prompt-response pair for retrieval
- **FR-012**: System MUST function without requiring network requests after initial setup
- **FR-013**: System MUST display response text as streaming tokens that appear word-by-word as they are generated
- **FR-014**: System MUST queue prompts submitted during model loading and display a loading indicator in the response area until the model is ready
- **FR-014a**: System MUST allow users to cancel queued or generating prompts by pressing Esc, while preserving the prompt text in the input box
- **FR-015**: System MUST display a descriptive error message in the response area when generation fails and provide a manual retry mechanism
- **FR-016**: System MUST intercept and prevent Cmd-K/Ctrl-K from triggering any existing page shortcuts, giving the component activation precedence
- **FR-017**: System MUST store conversation pairs without count limit until browser storage quota is reached, then display an error message to the user

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Conversation Pair**: A stored unit consisting of a user prompt, AI response, searchable representation (embedding), and metadata (timestamp, model version). These pairs accumulate over time to form conversation history.
- **Chat Session**: A temporary interaction state tracking the current prompt input, active response generation, visibility state, and focus position within the component.

## Notes
**Clarifications Completed**: All 5 critical ambiguities resolved in Session 2025-10-01:
1. Visual feedback: Streaming text (word-by-word tokens)
2. Model loading: Queue prompts with loading indicator, Esc to cancel
3. Error handling: Display error message with manual retry
4. Keyboard conflicts: Component takes precedence
5. Storage policy: Unlimited until quota exceeded, then error

**Minor Edge Cases Deferred** (low impact for POC):
- Multiple component instances behavior
- Extremely long prompt/response handling
- Rapid repeated shortcut presses
